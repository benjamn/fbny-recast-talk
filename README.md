Abstract
---

The future of JavaScript is too exciting to put on hold while native
implementations get around to supporting much-needed new features like
classes, generator functions, and modules. This talk dives into the
concepts and techniques involved in transforming these futuristic syntaxes
into JavaScript-of-today, through the lens of Facebook's Regenerator
project, which efficiently simulates ES6 generator functions (and soon
async functions too!) using plain ES5. Listeners will come away from this
talk with a deep understanding of Regenerator's implementation, and also
(hopefully!) a headful of ideas and tools for designing transforms of
their own.

Bio

A common thread that runs through my history of employment at Meebo,
Apture, Mozilla, Quora, and Facebook is a passion for exploring the limits
of dynamic programming languages. Many of my most recent projects at
Facebook, including [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[Regenerator](http://facebook.github.io/regenerator/), have involved
large-scale automatic code transformation that would be difficult or
impossible without the tool chain I've developed over the last two
years. As one of Facebook's delegates to the TC39 standards body tasked
with specifying the next version of JavaScript (ECMAScript 6), I am
especially excited about the future of the language and how we might bring
about that future as quickly as possible.
